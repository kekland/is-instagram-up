# is-instagram-up

(not only Instagram though)

It is now a common practice in **Kazakhstan** to block *Instagram*, *Telegram*, and other *social networks* at around **8PM**. This bot will help you know if the problem is due to your internet connection or **government blocked** those services.

This is actually a **huge issue** in **Kazakhstan** and I hope that this bot/app will raise awareness in the youth about **Net Neutrality**.

# Launching

```bash
npm start
```

# Contact me

*(I hope the government will not ban this bot)*
